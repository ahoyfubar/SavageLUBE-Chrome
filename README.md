# SavageLUBE Chrome

The Savage Love Usability Browser Extension (SavageLUBE) is a browser extension that rearranges and improves the comments section for the [Savage Love](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove) advice column at thestranger.com.

The Chrome version of the extension has been incorporated into the [original SavageLUBE project](https://github.com/ahoyfubar/SavageLUBE), which now supports Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
