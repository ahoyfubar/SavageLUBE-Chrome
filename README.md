# SlogBlocker

SlogBlocker is a Google Chrome Extension that rearranges and improves the DOM when viewing the comments section for the [Savage Love Blog (SLOG)](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove).

1. It creates duplicate page navigation buttons at the top of the comments pages.
2. It moves the name of each writer from the end of their comment to the top.
3. It allows you to click a writer's avatar, and select a replacement avatar of your own.
4. It allows you to block a writer. They no longer appear in the comments pages. You can unblock a writer in the SlogBlocker Extension settings (see below).
5. It allows you to mute a writer. They appear, but their comments are not shown. If a writer is muted, you can click "Show Comment" to read what they wrote.
