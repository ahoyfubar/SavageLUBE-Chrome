# SlogBlocker Chrome

SlogBlocker Chrome is a browser extension that rearranges and improves the comments section for the [Savage Love Blog (SLOG)](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove).

The Chrome version of the extension has been incorporated into the [original SlogBlocker project](https://github.com/ahoyfubar/SlogBlocker), which now supports Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
